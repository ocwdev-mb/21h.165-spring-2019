Take-Home Exam Essays
---------------------

There will be three essays due for completion throughout the course. Each will account for 15% of the final course grade.

_Essay #1_

Pick ONE question only:

1.  Shillington seems to suggest that it was largely Europeans and African chiefs and leaders who led the social-economic and political changes that took place in Africa between the 16{{< sup "th" >}} and 19{{< sup "th" >}} centuries. Do you agree with him? To what extent were the actions of ordinary men and women important to these changes?
2.  Discuss some of the ways in which the ecology and physical environments of eastern and central Africa helped structure the history of these regions between 16{{< sup "th" >}} and 19{{< sup "th" >}} centuries?
3.  Please explain the connections (if any) between the trans-Saharan trade and the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

The paper should be 2–3 pages long, double spaced.

This essay is due during Session 4.

_Essay #2_

Please write a paper in which you analyze colonial power in the context of African leisure in Zanzibar and British central Africa. Was colonial power all encompassing? How does colonial power with regard to African leisure compare to that in other areas we have previously examined, areas such as labor recruitment, female circumcision, taxation, etc., for example? Please make sure that your paper has a sophisticated thesis and that it is written clearly and eloquently. If you need help please consult the [Writing and Communication Center](https://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/).

The paper should be 3 pages long, double spaced.

This essay is due during Session 10.
